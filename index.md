We are a privately owned software company. <br/>
We are working on ~potentially~ fastest analytics framework on the planet. <br/>
We want to scale Machine Learning to the size of datasets and networks never seen before.
				
## Our approach

We design fault-tolerant asynchronous algorithms <br/>
&rarr; *that can distribute our workloads over **networks with millions of devices***<br/>
	
And implement them in templated C++, OpenCL and CUDA code <br/>
&rarr; *to achieve **bare metal performance** on any platform*<br/>
	
Without major 3rd party software dependencies <br/>
&rarr; *to make it **portable to any server or even mobile & IoT devices***

## Our team

We are a small group of senior developers. We are scattered across the globe. We come from CS or life sciences backgrounds. Most importantly, we are passionate about solving problems of humanity through Artificial Intelligence.

If you are like us, if you love ambitious projects, if you enjoy reading and writing scientific papers with sophisticated math and want to **apply** your skills in a single project - [reach us, we are hiring!](mailto:a@unum.xyz)

## Our framework

Our story started in November 2015. Today our IP is a set of modular libraries with a wide range of functionality, including, but not limited to:
- **Unique [Recurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) and [Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00596) models.**
- **Largest collection of [Graph processing algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_algorithms).**
- Classical Machine Learning models.
- [Crawlers and Spiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler), that can scan Internet faster, than anybody.
- Fast memory allocators and concurrency synchronization primitives.
- Continuously growing distributed database of [ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)).
