### Unum.xyz

We are a team of software developers.<br/>
We work on next-generation tools for machine learning.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to help solve the most computationally-demanding problems with powerful software:
- Clustering relevant information for educational purposes.
- Simulating complex biological systems for medical research.
- Analyzing our ever-changing habitat to improve the quality of life.

# Our Goal

**Our goal is to build a framework for Artificial Intelligence**, just like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), that:
- Trains AI models **much cheaper and faster**!
- Runs on servers **and on mobile, desktop & IoT devices**.
- Is distributed and **fault-tolerant** at its core!
- Learns **continuously** with hot-swappable streams of data!

### Our Research

- Innovative [Recurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) and [Graph Neural](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00596) Networks.
- Quasi-Polynomial [Graph Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_algorithms).
- Knowledge representation and construction of [Ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)).

### Our Technology Stack

- Implementation languages: C++17, **OpenCL** and **CUDA**.
- Bindings: **Python**, Swift & Java are in development.
- CI/CD tools: GitLab, **Docker**, Conda & Conan.

### Our Team

We are a small group of senior developers. We are scattered across the globe. We come from computer- or life- science backgrounds. Most importantly, we are passionate about solving problems of humanity through Artificial Intelligence.

If you are like us, if you like ambitious projects, if you enjoy reading and writing scientific papers with advanced calculus and want to apply these skills **&rarr; [reach us, we are hiring!](mailto:hr@unum.xyz)**

### Public Appearances

- Lecture @ Synopsys HQ in Palo Alto, CA, USA. [Computational graphs and AI in C++](https://github.com/ashvardanian/NeuralSTL)
- Lecture @ JetBrains HQ in St. Petersburg, Russia. [Efficient GPGPU Programming](https://github.com/ashvardanian/SandboxGPUs), [Video](https://youtu.be/BUtHOftDm_Y)
- Lecture @ CppRussia Conference in St. Petersburg, Russia. [Deep dive into GPGPU programming](https://cppconf-piter.ru/en/2019/spb/talks/68dwcymif21zt9eyjn6ge1/)

### Upcoming Projects

- __C* Programming Language__, that brings together the simplicity of Common LISP and power of C++. [Read more...](cstar)
- __C* Interpreter & Compiler__, that fits into 30K lines of clean standardardized C++20 code. [Read more...](compiler)
- __Bindings for Swift & Java__.
- __WebAssembly__ compilation.

### Cool Facts

- After the first prototypes were built, the project was in **no-compile** state for 2 years.
- Our entire codebase is **documented**, **containerized** and is continuously deployed with **GitLab** CI/CD pipelines.
- Everuthing including graph algorithms, neural networks, databases and networking fits into **200K lines of code**. 
- We were started as C++11 project, but had already migrated to C++14, C++17 and now transitioning to **C++20**.
- We are "public cloud"-ready, but operate our own **High-Performance Cluster** to increase cost-effectiveness.
- We are compatible with: **Linux**, MacOS, iOS, and Android.
