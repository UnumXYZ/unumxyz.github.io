# Unum

We are a small international team of senior computer scientists.<br/>
We work on next-generation Machine Learning foundational technologies and some applications:<br/>

* [Semantic Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search) for scientific and educational purposes.
* Optimal [Resource Allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_allocation) and orchestration in complex environments.
* [Recommender Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) with on-the-fly update capabilities.

## The Unum Ecosystem

Most companies select their niche and stick to it. Our approach is different. We co-design software and hardware, scientific models and their applications. Thatâ€™s why we consistently outperform competitors in most workloads **by a factor of 10x**. Components:

* [Artificial Intelligence Research](https://unum.xyz/ai).
* [High-Performance Databases](https://unum.xyz/db).
* [Language & Compiler Design](https://unum.xyz/cstar).
* Consumer Applications.
* Hardware Design.
