We are a team of software developers.<br/>
We work on next-generation tools for machine learning.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to help solve the most computationally-demanding problems with powerful software:
- Clustering relevant information for educational purposes.
- Simulating complex biological systems for medical research.
- Analyzing our ever-changing habitat to improve the quality of life.

# Our Goal

**Our goal is to build a framework for Artificial Intelligence**, just like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), that:
- Trains AI models **much cheaper and faster**!
- Runs on servers **and on mobile, desktop & IoT devices**.
- Is distributed and **fault-tolerant** at its core!
- Learns **continuously** with hot-swappable streams of data!

### Our Research

- Innovative [Recurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) and [Graph Neural](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00596) Networks.
- Quasi-Polynomial [Graph Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_algorithms).
- Knowledge representation and construction of [Ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)).

### Our Technology Stack

- The core is written in C++17, OpenCL and CUDA.
- Side-projects and pipelines are written in Python and Swift.
- Integrates with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Docker & Conan.
- Works on-premise, but can be distributed to a public cloud.

### Our Team

We are a small group of senior developers. We are scattered across the globe. We come from computer- or life- science backgrounds. Most importantly, we are passionate about solving problems of humanity through Artificial Intelligence.

If you are like us, if you like ambitious projects, if you enjoy reading and writing scientific papers with advanced calculus and want to apply these skills **&rarr; [reach us, we are hiring!](mailto:hr@unum.xyz)**
