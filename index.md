We are a privately owned software company. <br/>
We are working on the fastest analytics framework on the planet. <br/>
We want to scale Machine Learning to the size of datasets and networks never seen before.
				
## Our approach

- We design fault-tolerant asynchronous algorithms<br/>
	... that can distribute our workloads over **networks with millions of devices**
- And implement them in templated C++, OpenCL and CUDA code<br/>
	... to achieve **bare metal performance** on any platform
- Without major 3rd party software dependencies<br/>
	... to make it **portable to any server or even mobile & IoT devices**

## Our team

We are a small group of senior developers. We are scattered across the globe. We come from CS or life sciences backgrounds. Most importantly, we are passionate about solving problems of humanity through Artificial Intelligence.

If you are like us, if you love ambitious projects, if you enjoy reading and writing scientific papers with sophisticated math and want to **apply** your skills in a single project - [reach us, we are hiring!](mailto:a@unum.xyz)

## Our framework

Our story started in November 2015. Today our IP is a set of modular libraries with a wide range of functionality, including, but not limited to:
- Classical Machine Learning models.
- Authored Recurrent and Graph Neural Network designs.
- Largest collection of Graph processing algorithms.
- Crawlers and Spiders, that can scan Internet faster, than anybody.
- Some of the fastest memory allocators on the planet.
- Huge continuously growing and changing knowledge graph.

## Public appearences

- Lecture given @ Synopsys HQ in Palo Alto, CA, USA. [Computational graphs and AI in C++](https://github.com/ashvardanian/NeuralSTL)
- Lecture given @ JetBrains in St. Petersburg, Russia. [Efficient GPGPU Programming](https://youtu.be/BUtHOftDm_Y)
- Lecture given @ CppRussia Conference in St. Petersburg, Russia. [Deep dive into GPGPU programming](https://github.com/ashvardanian/SandboxGPUs)

## Upcoming projects

- __C*__ programming language, that brings together the simplicity of Scheme LISP and power of C++.
- __Compiler__ that is under 100K lines of modern C++ code.
