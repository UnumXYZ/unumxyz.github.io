We rethink data-processing, both in **theory** and in **practice**!
New algorithms design and performant implementations.

## Why we want it?

- Free-to-use model doesn't exist and users pay for analytics in one way or another.
- As we progress, the demand for computed analytics increases, as do the prices.
- So we rethink software design to reduce the costs by an order of magnitude!
				
## How we do it?

- Fault tolerant asynchronous algorithms
- Scales to millions of devices
- Implemented in templated C++, OpenCL and CUDA
- Bare metal performance
- Minimal dependencies on 3rd party software
- Cross-platform tiny binaries

## Where you can see our work?

- Mobile apps in the "Semantic" lineup with local on-device analytics
- Private business-oriented software packages

## We are hiring! ...only senior developers

- If you are not afraid of abnormal programming
- If you are proficient in close-to-metal programming
- If you can read and write papers with sophisticated math on:
	- Artificial Intelligence
	- Graph Theory
	- Computational Complexity
- If you want to actually **apply** those insane skills in a serious project
	- ... why are you still reading this?! Reach us!

# Current State

## What's already implemented?

- Classical Machine Learning models
- Authored Recurrent and Graph Neural Network designs
- Largest collection of Graph processing algorithms
- Crawlers and Spiders, that can scan Internet faster, than anybody
- Some of the fastest memory allocators on the planet
- Huge continuously growing and changing knowledge graph!

## Public Resources & Appearence

- Lecture given @ Synopsys HQ in Palo Alto, CA, USA. [Computational graphs and AI in C++](https://github.com/ashvardanian/NeuralSTL)
