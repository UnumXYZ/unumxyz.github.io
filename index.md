We are a software company working on a high-performance analytics library.<br/> 
We want to train & apply Artificial Intelligence on the scale beyond current limits.
				
## Our Approach

We design fault-tolerant asynchronous algorithms <br/>
&rarr; *that can distribute our workloads over **networks with millions of devices!***<br/>
	
And implement them in templated C++, OpenCL and CUDA code <br/>
&rarr; *to achieve **bare metal performance on any platform!***<br/>
	
Without major 3rd party software dependencies <br/>
&rarr; *to make it **portable to any server or even mobile & IoT devices!***

## Our Team

We are a small group of senior developers. We are scattered across the globe. We come from computer- or life- science backgrounds. Most importantly, we are passionate about solving problems of humanity through Artificial Intelligence.

If you are similar to us, if you like ambitious projects, if you enjoy reading and writing scientific papers with advanced calculus and want to apply these skills **&rarr; [reach us, we are hiring!](mailto:hr@unum.xyz)**

## Our Framework

Our story began in November 2015. Today we manage a set of modular libraries with a wide range of functionality, including, but not limited to:
- **Unique [Recurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) and [Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00596) models.**
- **Largest collection of [Graph processing algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_algorithms).**
- Classical Machine Learning models.
- [Crawlers and Spiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler), that can scan Internet faster, than anybody.
- Fast memory allocators and concurrency synchronization primitives.
- Continuously growing distributed database of [ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)).
