# About Unum

Unum was founded by [Ashot Vardanian](https://ashvardanian.com) in November 2015.<br/>

* We are small and flexible, and we enjoy that. The same goes for our codebase.
* We are privately funded, so bureaucracy is reduced to a minimum.
* We have no sales & marketing departments, only R&D.
* Our base is in [Armenia](https://itis.am/eng), but we come from all around the globe.

If you are like us, if you enjoy inter-disciplinary research, if you are not scared of ambitious projects and competitive working environments â†’ [get in touch, we are hiring!](mailto:hr@unum.xyz) 

## Public Appearances

* Lecture @ Synopsys HQ in Palo Alto, CA, USA. [Computational Graphs and AI in C++](https://github.com/ashvardanian/NeuralSTL) 
* Lecture @ JetBrains HQ in St. Petersburg, Russia. [Efficient GPGPU Programming](https://github.com/ashvardanian/SandboxGPUs), [Video](https://youtu.be/BUtHOftDm_Y) 
* Lecture @ CppRussia Conference in St. Petersburg, Russia. [Deep dive into GPGPU programming](https://cppconf-piter.ru/en/2019/spb/talks/68dwcymif21zt9eyjn6ge1/) 

## Technology Stack

* Implementation languages: C++17, OpenCL and CUDA.
* Bindings: Python. Swift & Java are in development.
* CI/CD tools: GitLab, Docker, Conda & Conan.

## Cool Facts

* Everything including Graph algorithms, Neural Networks, databases and networking code, tests, documentation and CI/CD specifications fits into just 200K lines of code. For comparison, TensorFlow that only works with Neural Networks alone has 2.2 mln lines of code (11x the volume).
* Unum codebase was originally implemented in C++11 but later migrated to C++14, C++17. Now we are transitioning to C++20.
* After completing the prototypes, the project was in a no-compile state for 2 years. That time was mostly spent searching for optimal ways to organize the code.
