# About Unum

Unum was founded by [Ashot Vardanian](https://ashvardanian.com) in November 2015.<br/>

* We are small and flexible, and we enjoy that. The same goes for our codebase.
* We are privately funded, so bureaucracy is reduced to a minimum.
* We have no sales & marketing departments, only R&D.
* Our base is in [Armenia](https://itis.am/eng), but we come from all around the globe.

If you are like us, if you enjoy inter-disciplinary research, if you are not scared of ambitious projects and competitive working environments â†’ [get in touch, we are hiring]!(mailto:hr@unum.xyz)!
