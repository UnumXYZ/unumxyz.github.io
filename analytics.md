# Analytics Solutions

Once the data is sampled from the storage layer, following analytical components are used to infer insights. Pipelines of such analytical solutions can then be combined into any State-of-the-Art products like:

* Search Articles like Google or Yandex = [BERT](#transformers) + [kANN](#k-nearest-neighbors-search) + [VectorDB](/storage/graphs) + [DocsDB](/storage/texts).
* Catalog & Analyze Complex Proteins = [Graphlets](#subgraph-isomorphism) + [GNNs](#geometric-deep-learning) + [GraphDB](/storage/graphs).
* Detect Anomalies in Financial Transactions = [BwNNs](#bitwise--quantized-neural-network) + [Flow Analysis](#max-flow--min-cut) + [GNNs](#geometric-deep-learning) + [GraphDB](/storage/graphs).
