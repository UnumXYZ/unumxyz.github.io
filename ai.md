# Unum.AI

Unum was started in 2015 purely as AI Research project. Unum.AI is simultaneously the oldest and least mature part of the Unum.XYZ framework. It's too early to share the results, so we can only share the research directions we are focusing on:

- Innovative [Recurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) and [Graph Neural](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00596) Networks.
- Knowledge representation forms and construction of [Ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)).
- Quasi-Polynomial [Graph Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_algorithms) to accelerate reasoning over large [Knowledge Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph).
