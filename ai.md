# Unum.AI

Unum.AI is simultaneously the oldest and the least mature part of the framework. We research Artficial Intelligence through **Information Theory** and **Computational Complexity Theory**, but it's too early to share the results. Here are the research directions we are taking:

- Innovative [Recurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) and [Graph Neural](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00596) Networks.
- Knowledge representation forms and construction of [Ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)).
- Quasi-Polynomial [Graph Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_algorithms) to accelerate reasoning over large [Knowledge Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph).
