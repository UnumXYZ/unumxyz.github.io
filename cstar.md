# C* Programming Language

## Why it appeared?

- For efficient code generation we need flexible compilers, but C++ is too hard to parse.
- Languages like LISP are dynamically typed, which makes them too slow for HPC.
- C doesn't have RAII, overload resolution, templates or generics.
- Languages like Rust, Swift and D are also overcomplicated with enums and modern pattern matching.

## Language Specs

- Context-free grammar.
- Static typing.
- Extendable keywords set.
- Modular compiler.
